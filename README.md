# NYC Open Jobs (Android App)

This is a Kotlin-based Android app designed to help users explore job opportunities offered by New York City government agencies. The app works similarly to the official [NYC Open Data job listings](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/) site, but in a much cleaner and mobile-friendly format.

You can scroll through job postings, search by keywords, and tap on any listing to view full details about the position â€” including job title, salary, qualifications, and more. The UI has been carefully designed with Jetpack Compose to make the experience smooth and intuitive.

Two main screens have been updated for better usability:
- **HomeScreen.kt** now includes a search bar and a cleaner job list.
- **DetailScreen.kt** has been improved to display detailed job information in a readable way.

Whether you're just browsing or seriously job-hunting, this app makes it easier to find city jobs right from your phone.
